# Routine Reminder API: Group Project

In this project our team collaborated using Git to create a C# .NET Framework Application to function as a daily reminder and organizer system for individuals with busy schedules. Our Web API utilized an n-tier structure with Data, Models, Services, and Web API tiers. We then used PostMan to test the functionality of our Endpoints.
